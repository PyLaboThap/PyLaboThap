Connector
=========

This section includes details on the connectors of the PyLaboThap library.

The purpose of the **Connector class** is to link components between each other. There are trhee different types of connectors that represent different
types of energy transfer within the system;

- **Mass Connector**: energy transfer in the form of mass flow (:math:`\dot{m} \cdot h`).
- **Heat Connector**: energy transfer in the form of heat flow (:math:`\dot{Q}`).
- **Work Connector**: energy transfer in the form of work flow (:math:`\dot{W}`).

Example
-------
Consider a compressor connected to a motor. 
The compressor is connected with connectors:

   <ul>
        <li><strong>Two mass connectors</strong>: supply and exhaust mass flow that can be connected to an evaporator and a condenser, for example.</li>
        <li><strong>One heat connector</strong>: heat flow is connected to the ambient air.</li>
        <li><strong>One work connector</strong>: work flow is connected to a motor.</li>
   </ul>
